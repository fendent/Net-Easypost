=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item _build_fieldnames

Attributes that make up an Address, from L<Net::Easypost::Resource>

=item _build_role

Prefix to data when POSTing to the Easypost API about Address objects

=item _build_operation

Base API endpoint for operations on Address objects

=item clone

Make a new copy of this object and return it

=item as_string

Format this address as it might be seen on a mailing label. This class overloads
stringification using this method, so something like C<say $addr> should just work.

=item merge

This method takes a L<Net::Easypost::Address> object and an arrayref of fields to copy
into B<this> object. This method only merges fields that are defined on the other object.

=item verify

This method takes a L<Net::Easypost::Address> object and verifies its underlying
address.

If a non-US address is asked for verification, a warning will be
emitted and the object itself will be returned.
